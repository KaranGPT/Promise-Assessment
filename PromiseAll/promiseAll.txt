// Usage

Promise.all() method accepts an iterable Object such as an Array of promises as an input & 
returns a single promise that resolves to a result array of the input promises.

When all input promises have been resolved or the iterable input does not contain a promise,
the return promise will be resolved.

It rejects immediately when an input promise rejects or non-promise throws an error and
will reject with that first rejection message/error message.

It is often used when there are many asynchronous tasks involved that the overall code
relies on to work successfully.

When an empty iterable is passed, the promise returned by this method is executed synchronously. 
The resolved value will be an empty array.

When a non-empty iterable is passed, and all of the promises fulfill or are not promises,
the promise returned by this method will be executed asynchronously.
